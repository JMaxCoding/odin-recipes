# odin-recipes
First Odin Project... project!

I have completed the project! In it, I have shown what I have learned with HTML, setting up boilerplate pages, an index page, several relative linked pages, and images. I feel I even used AI in a creative way and not for the code at all - to create the interesting recipes and pictures for them! I even added a splash image to the front page too! I am happy with what I have and looking forward to what comes next!
